# Type Conversion

## Introduction to Type Conversion

- A process of converting a value from one type (source type) to another type (destination type).

## Implicit Casting

- The 'lower-numerical type' can be automatically (implicitly) converted into 'higher-numerical type'.
    - depends on number of bytes.

## Explicit Casting

- Manually converting a value from 1 data type to another data type, by specifying the destination data type within brackets, at left-hand side of the source value.
- **Loose Conversion**: If the _destination type is not sufficient-enough to store the converted value_, the value may loose.
- `(DestinationDataType) SourceValue`
- When to use?
    - At all cases of implicit casting.
    - At all cases of explicit casting.
    - Child class to Parent class.
